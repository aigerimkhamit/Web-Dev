<h6>Posted on 12th September 2021.</h6>

<p>We are studying "Programming Principles 1" subject at university. I'm not really getting into it, because I don't understand everything, because I haven't studied any programming languages at school. We were drawing on paint all the time in "Informatics" class.</p>
<p>Anyway studying something new is interesting, and I believe I'll get through it.</p>
