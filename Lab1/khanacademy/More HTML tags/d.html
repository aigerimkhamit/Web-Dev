<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Prepare all ingredients. Any piece of beef without veins is suitable for the dish.
</p>
<p><img src="https://img1.russianfood.com/dycontent/images_upl/497/sm_496473.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The meat should be cut across the grain into strips as thin as possible. With a sharp knife, this is easy to do.
</p>
<p><img src="https://img1.russianfood.com/dycontent/images_upl/497/sm_496474.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Put the beef in a bowl, add the egg, 0.5 teaspoon of salt, ground black pepper and 1 tbsp. a spoonful of soy sauce.
</p>
<p><img src="https://img1.russianfood.com/dycontent/images_upl/497/sm_496475.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Also add 1 tbsp. a spoonful of starch, mix and leave the meat for 5-10 minutes.
</p>
<p><img src="https://img1.russianfood.com/dycontent/images_upl/497/sm_496476.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan and add half of the beef. The meat should be in a pan in one layer, so when quickly fried over high heat, it will retain all the juices.
</p>
<p><img src="https://img1.russianfood.com/dycontent/images_upl/497/sm_496479.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Fry the beef over high heat on all sides for 3-4 minutes, until the color changes and is lightly browned.
  Then transfer the fried meat to a plate and fry the next batch.

<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> In a skillet, heat 1-2 tbsp. tablespoons of vegetable oil and put the chopped pepper. Saute the peppers for 2 minutes, until soft.
</p>
<p><img src="https://img1.russianfood.com/dycontent/images_upl/497/sm_496482.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Add onions to the pan to the pepper, fry together for another 3-4 minutes.
</p>
<p><img src="https://img1.russianfood.com/dycontent/images_upl/497/sm_496483.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> Transfer the meat to the pan along with the oil and juice. Add 1-2 tbsp. spoons of soy sauce, sugar and vinegar. Stir.
</p>
<p><img src="https://img1.russianfood.com/dycontent/images_upl/497/sm_496484.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Step 13:</strong>1 st. dilute a spoonful of starch in 50 ml of drinking water and pour the mixture into the pan. Stir to coat all the ingredients in the sauce and simmer for 1 minute.
